PHP to get your Brigham Young University (BYU) class schedule as an iCal file.
This will need adjustment for each term, and doesn't catch exceptions to the class
schedule, or add stuff like exams, but hopefully it's a nice start, especially if
you're going to be juggling your schedule around in the first few weeks of class.

It steals your BYU cookie, so make sure you're OK with that, and you'll have to
host it on a *.byu.edu server with HTTPS.  I have it hosted at
https://students.cs.byu.edu/~jjhewitt/classical.php
The cookie scope will eventually be closed down to just byu.edu, so this will stop
working.

Here's some documentation on the cookie stealing; it's an intentional open door
to do stuff like this. I may not be one of "OIT Core's campus partners whom [they]
trust", but I'm not malicious. It's unfortunate that when they close this cookie
scope loophole, arbitrary guys like me won't be able to do helpful stuff like this
without applying for an API key we'll likely be denied, or taking the user's
credentials.
